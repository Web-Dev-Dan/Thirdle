# Thirdle

📝 Thirdle is a simplified version of the popular word game, Wordle, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🛠 There will be a 3x3 grid in which the user's guess will be displayed.

✍️ User guess can be entered using key presses or by clicking the on-screen keyboard.

⭐️ Letters that are correct will be displayed blue, those that are in the wrong place will be orange, and incorrect letters will be dark grey.

✍️ Bonus features include a 'hint' button, a 'stats' button, and a 'rules' button.

👀 DEMO: You can view the progress on this project [here](https://web-dev-dan.github.io/Thirdle/).
